# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Bert
Personal project of sentiment analysis of website reviews using BERT and Python. I have uploaded the .py and .ipynb files.
The project deals with web scrapping data of a webpage such in this case the reviews. It then ranks the reviews on a scale of 1-5. with 1 being  vey unhappy to 5 being very happy. The project is a demonstration of pre trained model of neural networks.
