       "\"I have to admit that I've never watched any of the animated show One Piece or even heard about it for that matter. I'm really not a big fan of anime. Then after watching the trailers for this I thought it looked like a show for children. I was wrong. I kept reading about how good this show is and how it's #1 on Netflix so I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did because I couldn't have been more wrong. This is a show where people of all ages can enjoy. If you can just turn off your brain and watch I promise you'll have a good time. If you're looking for a new show to binge then give One Piece a try. You won't be disappointed!\""

       "\"One Piece is one heck of an anime series that eludes anyone adapting to live action. The amount of special effects would be ridiculous. With the rubbery moves and silliness, it's an expensive challenge to make.Netflix' One Piece under the Japanese producers' watch eyes is a good adaptation. It might not be perfect, but from the storyline, casting and atory telling, it is One Piece.The directors took 1-2 steps backwards in term of CGI is a wise decision. Season 1 focused on the main crew recruitment was pretty much exactly what initial One Piece episodes are.Now that the main crew had been gathered, the series would face a much more difficult challenges due to the bigger crew recruitments and enemies.The casting was impressive, each Straw Hat Pirate member was matched accordingly that when you're an old fan of One Piece, you woukd recognize them in an instant. While if you're a new audience, you'll enjoy how tight the Straw Hat Pirate crew was illustrated.Good job, hopefully the 2nd season would up the ante.\""
